## Introduction
This project aims to analyze heart disease data to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding the factors contributing to heart disease. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RaviMosalpuri/HeartDisease.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd HeartDisease
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Code.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis.

## Machine Learning Techniques
The analysis in this project utilizes the following machine learning techniques:
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification to predict the presence of heart disease.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble learning method used for classification and getting the top 5 important features affecting heart health.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data points into distinct groups.
